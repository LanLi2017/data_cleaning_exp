Falseevent`text_transform`Based on the given examples and purpose, I will write a Python expression to transform the data in the target column "event".

The purpose is to figure out how many different events are recorded in the collected menus.

Here's the Python expression:

```
jython: import re; pattern = re.compile(r'[^ ]+'); match = pattern.search(value); if match: value = match.group(0).strip(); return value
```

This expression uses regular expressions to extract the event name from each cell in the "event" column. The regular expression `r'[^ ]+'` matches one or more characters that are not spaces, effectively capturing the entire event name. The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted event name.I will evaluate the performance of the applied function based on the provided examples.

Example 1:
The purpose is to figure out the place that has a population in 2009 higher than 500,000.
The rationale is that cell values in column "population; census 2009" should be transformed into numerical type.
Arguments: column: "population; census 2009", expression: "jython: return int(value)"
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

Evaluation: The new values are all integers, which is consistent and correct. Therefore, the performance of this function is good.

Example 2:
The purpose is to figure out how many counties are recorded in total.
The rationale is that cell values in column "county" should be normalized.
Arguments: column: county, expression: "jython: return value.upper()"
Output: MOMBASA | KWALE | KILIFI

Evaluation: The new values are all uppercase strings, which is consistent and correct. Therefore, the performance of this function is good.

Example 3:
The purpose is to figure out which month in 2018 got the highest last review.
The rationale is that cell values in column "last_review" should be date format.
Arguments: column: last_review, expression: "jython: from datetime import datetime\ndate_obj = datetime.strptime(value, '%m/%d/%y')\nformatted_date = date_obj.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\nreturn formatted_date"
Output: 2018-11-12 | 2018-08-12 | 2018-10-29

Evaluation: The new values are all dates in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', which is consistent and correct. Therefore, the performance of this function is good.

Example 4:
The purpose is to find who places 1st in 1991 or 1992.
The rationale is that cell values in column "Position" should be extracted using regular expression.
Arguments: column: Position, expression: "jython: import re\npattern = re.compile(r'^\d+')\nmatch = pattern.match(value)\nif match:\n  value = match.group(0)\n  return value"
Output: 10 | 1 | 14

Evaluation: The new values are all numbers, which is consistent and correct. Therefore, the performance of this function is good.

Based on these examples, I will return:
