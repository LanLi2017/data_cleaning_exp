To answer the question, we can first use add_column() to add more columns by applying transformations.

The required arguments for add_column() include: new_column, expression. With expression defined, the new column could be based on copying pasting the original value from the base column, or using transformation to process and 
append values to new column. The simplest way to use this operation is simply leave the default {{value}} in the expression field, to create an exact copy of your column.

One useful expression is to create a column based on concatenating (merging) two other columns. Use the following format in the expression window:
cells["Column 1"].value + cells["Column 2"].value
If your column names do not contain spaces, you can use the following format instead:
cells.Column1.value + cells.Column2.value

/*
col : week | when | kickoff | opponent | results; final score | results; team record | game site | attendance
row 1 : 1 | saturday, april 13 | 7:00 p.m. | at rhein fire | w 27–21 | 1–0 | rheinstadion | 32,092
row 2 : 2 | saturday, april 20 | 7:00 p.m. | london monarchs | w 37–3 | 2–0 | waldstadion | 34,186
row 3 : 3 | sunday, april 28 | 6:00 p.m. | at barcelona dragons | w 33–29 | 3–0 | estadi olímpic de montjuïc | 17,503
*/
Purpose: Return top 5 competitions that have the most attendance.
The existing columns are: "week", "when", "kickoff", "opponent", "results; final score", "results; team record", "game site", "attendance".
Explanation: We copy the value from column "attendance" and create a new column "attendance number" for each row.
Therefore, the answer is: add_column(column="attendance", expression="value", new_column="attendance number"). The value: 32,092 | 34,186 | 17,503


/*
col : rank | lane | player name| country | time
row 1 :  | 5 | olga tereshkova |  kaz    | 51.86
row 2 :  | 6 | manjeet kaur    |  ind    | 52.17
row 3 :  | 3 | asami tanno     |  jpn    | 53.04
*/
Purpose: return the player information, including both name and country 
The existing columns are: rank, lane, player, time.
Explanation: We add a new column based on concatenating the value from column "player name" and "country" for each row.
Therefore, the answer is: add_column(column="player name", expression="cells['player name'].value+ "-"+ cells['country'].value", new_column="player"). The value: olga tereshkova-kaz | manjeet kaur-ind | asami tanno-jpn
