To answer the question, we can first use reorder_rows() to sort the values in a column to get the order of the items. The order can be "large to small" or "small to large".

The column to sort should have these data types:
1. Numerical: the numerical strings that can be used in sort
2. DateType: the strings that describe a date, such as year, month, day
3. String: other strings

/*
col : Position | Club | Played | Points | Wins | Draws | Losses | Goals for | Goals against | Goal Difference
row 1 : 1 | Malaga CF | 42 | 79 | 22 | 13 | 7 | 72 | 47 | +25
row 10 : 10 | CP Merida | 42 | 59 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 48 | 41 | +7
row 3 : 3 | CD Numancia | 42 | 73 | 21 | 10 | 11 | 68 | 40 | +28
*/
Purpose: what club placed in the last position?
The existing columns are: Position, Club, Played, Points, Wins, Draws, Losses, Goals for, Goals against, Goal Difference.
Explanation: the question asks about the club in the last position. Each row is about a club. We need to know the order of position from last to front. There is a column for position and the column name is Position. The datatype is Numerical.
Therefore, the answer is: reorder_rows(Position), the order is "large to small".

/*
col : Year | Team | Games | Combined Tackles | Tackles | Assisted Tackles |
row 1 : 2004 | HOU | 16 | 63 | 51 | 12 |
row 2 : 2005 | HOU | 12 | 35 | 24 | 11 |
row 3 : 2006 | HOU | 15 | 26 | 19 | 7 |
*/
Question: in what year did babin have the least amount of tackles?
The existing columns are: Year, Team, Games, Combined Tackles, Tackles, Assisted Tackles.
Explanation: the question asks about the year with the least tackles. Each row is about a year. We need to know the order of tackles from the least to the most. There is a column for tackles and the column name is Tackles. The datatype is Numerical.
Therefore, the answer is: reorder_rows(Tackles), the order is "small to large".
