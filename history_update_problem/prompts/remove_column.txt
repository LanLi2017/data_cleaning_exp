To answer the question, we can first use remove_column() to drop the column.

The required arguments for remove_column() include: column. (column name that needs to be removed)

/*
col : rank | lane | player name| country | time  | player_name(preferred)
row 1 :  | 5 | olga tereshkova |  kaz    | 51.86 |
row 2 :  | 6 | manjeet kaur    |  ind    | 52.17 | NA
row 3 :  | 3 | asami tanno     |  jpn    | 53.04 |
*/
Purpose: return the player information, including both name and country 
The existing columns are: rank, lane, player, time, player_name(preferred).
Explanation: cell values in column player_name(preferred) are empty, therefore, we will remove it.
Therefore, the answer is: remove_column(column="player_name(preferred)")
