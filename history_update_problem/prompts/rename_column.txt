We call rename_column() to revise the column schema.

The required arguments for rename_column() include: new_column. Replace the old column name with new_column name for the table.

Question: what is the total number of counties with a population in 2009 higher than 500,000?
The existing columns are: Code, County, Former Province, Area (km2), Population; Census 2009, Capital.
Explanation: the question asks about the number of counties with a population in 2009 higher than 500,000. Each row is about one county. We rename the column "Population; Census 2009" as "Population".
Therefore, the answer is: rename_column(column="Population; Census 2009", new_column="Population"). The value: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735
