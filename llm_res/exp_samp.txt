The task is to extract the size information from a column of composite values expressing physical description of menus.

From the given data, we can see that the size information is in the format "digit x digit" or "digit unit measurement (cm, inches)" with some additional keywords like "folded", "open", and "unit".

Here's an example of how to extract the size information:

1. For values like "CARD; ILLUS; COL; 4.25X6.5;", we can extract the size as "4.25 x 6.5".
2. For values like "15x9cm folded; 15x18cm open", we can extract the size as "15 x 9 cm" and "15 x 18 cm".
3. For values like "28x21.5cm", we can extract the size as "28 x 21.5 cm".

Here's a Python code snippet to extract the size information:

```python
import re

def extract_size(data):
    pattern = r"(\d+(?:\.\d+)?(?: x \d+(?:\.\d+)?)*)"
    sizes = []
    for value in data.values():
        match = re.search(pattern, str(value))
        if match:
            size = match.group(1).replace("fold. ; ill.", "").strip()
            sizes.append(size)
    return sizes

data = {"example repair": {"8 x 5 in. fold. ; ill.": "8 x 5 in."}}
print(extract_size(data))
```

This code uses the `re` module to search for patterns in the data values. The pattern is designed to match strings that contain digits, decimal points, and spaces, which are common in the size information. The function then extracts the matched string and strips out any unnecessary characters before returning a list of sizes.

Note: This code assumes that the size information is always present in the format "digit x digit" or "digit unit measurement (cm, inches)" with some additional keywords like "folded", "open", and "unit". If there are cases where the size information is missing or in a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.Here is a Python script that extracts size information from the `physical_description` column in the `menu.csv` file:
```python
import pandas as pd
import re

# Load the menu dataset
df = pd.read_csv('menu.csv')

# Define the target column and the new column to create
target_column = 'physical_description'
new_column = 'size'

# Define a function to standardize cell values
def standardize_cell_value(cell_value):
    # Remove unnecessary characters (e.g. "fold.  ; ill.")
    cell_value = re.sub(r'fold\.  ; ill\.', '', cell_value)
    # Extract the size information using regular expressions
    pattern = r'(\d+(?:\.\d+)?(?: x \d+(?:\.\d+)?)*)'
    match = re.search(pattern, cell_value)
    if match:
        return match.group(1).strip()
    else:
        return None

# Apply the standardization function to each cell value in the target column
df[new_column] = df[target_column].apply(standardize_cell_value)

# Print the resulting dataframe with the new size column
print(df)
```
Here's how the script works:

1. It loads the `menu.csv` file into a Pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv`.
2. It defines the target column (`physical_description`) and the new column to create (`size`).
3. The `standardize_cell_value` function is defined to standardize each cell value in the target column. This function:
	* Removes unnecessary characters (e.g. "fold.  ; ill.") using regular expressions.
	* Extracts the size information using a regular expression pattern that matches strings containing digits, decimal points, and spaces.
4. The script applies the `standardize_cell_value` function to each cell value in the target column using the `apply` method.
5. The resulting DataFrame with the new `size` column is printed.

Note: This script assumes that the size information is always present in the format "digit x digit" or "digit unit measurement (cm, inches)" with some additional keywords like "folded", "open", and "unit". If there are cases where the size information is missing or in a different format, you may need to modify the script accordingly.
