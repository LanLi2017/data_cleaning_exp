# Here's a Python script that reads the `menu.csv` file, extracts the size information 
# from the `physical_description` column (assuming it contains consistent unit information), 
# and writes the extracted values to a new CSV file called `sizes.csv`. 
# In this example, I'll assume sizes are usually measured in feet and inches (1 foot â‰ˆ 12 inches).
# ```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the input CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('menu.csv')

# Assuming the physical_description column contains consistent unit information
def extract_sizes(row):
    size_str = row['physical_description'].split('/')[0]  # Extract size value (without 'x')
    size_value, width_value = size_str.split('\\')  # Split the string into two parts: actual size and width

    # Convert width from feet to inches using a conversion factor
    width_inches = int(width_value) * 12

    return float(size_value), width_inches

# Write the extracted sizes to a new CSV file
df['sizes'] = df.apply(extract_sizes, axis=1)
