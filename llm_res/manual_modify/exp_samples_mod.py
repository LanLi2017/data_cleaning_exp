# This script assumes that your CSV file is named `menu.csv`, and you want to save the output in a new file named `menu_with_sizes.csv`. You can adjust these names as needed.

# Here's how the script works:

# 1.  **Loading the dataset**: The script starts by loading your `menu.csv` file into a Pandas DataFrame called `df`.
# 2.  **Defining a function to extract size information**: The script defines a function called `extract_size` that takes a string (the value from the `physical_description` column) as input and returns the extracted size information.
# 3.  **Applying the function**: The script applies this function to each row in the `physical_description` column using the `apply` method, which calls the function for each element in the series.
# 4.  **Dropping rows without size information**: If a row doesn't have any size information (i.e., the `size` column is empty), you might want to drop that row from your dataset. This script does this using the `dropna` method with the `subset` argument set to `['size']`, which drops rows where the `size` column contains NaN values.
# 5.  **Saving the updated dataframe**: Finally, the script saves the updated DataFrame (with the new `size` column) in a new CSV file named `menu_with_sizes.csv`.

# When you run this script, it will create a new CSV file with an additional column called `size`, which contains the extracted size information from your original dataset.
