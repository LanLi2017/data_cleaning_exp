A fascinating problem!

Given the input data in the form of a column of composite values expressing physical description of menus, I'll outline the steps to extract size information from this target column `physical_description`.

**Step 1: Parse the input data**

Split each value in the `physical_description` column into individual components using whitespace or other delimiters. This will help us identify the different parts of the composite values.

Example:
```
Input: "52x34cm"
Parsed: ["52", "x", "34", "cm"]
```

**Step 2: Identify size information**

Look for patterns in the parsed data that indicate size information. In this case, we're looking for:

1. Singular values (e.g., "52") representing a single measurement.
2. Composite values with multiplication operators (`x`) and key words indicating unit measurements (e.g., "cm", "inches").

**Step 3: Extract size information**

Using the parsed data and identified patterns, extract the size information from each value in the `physical_description` column.

Example:
```
Input: ["52", "x", "34", "cm"]
Extracted Size Information: 52 x 34 cm
```

**Step 4: Format the extracted size information**

Present the extracted size information in a consistent format, such as:

* For singular values: `digit x digit` (e.g., "52 x 34")
* For composite values: `digit x digit unit measurement` (e.g., "52 x 34 cm")

**Step 5: Output the extracted size information**

Return the extracted size information for each value in the `physical_description` column.

Example:
```
Output: ["52 x 34 cm"]
```

By following these steps, we can successfully extract size information from the target column `physical_description`.Here's a Python script using Pandas and regular expressions (regex) to extract size information from the `physical_description` column in the `menu.csv` dataset:
```python
import pandas as pd
import re

# Load the menu dataset
df = pd.read_csv('menu.csv')

# Define a function to extract size information
def extract_size_info(text):
    pattern = r'(\d+)x(\d+)(?:\s*(inches|cm))?$'
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    if match:
        return f"{match.group(1)} x {match.group(2)}"
    else:
        return None

# Apply the function to the physical_description column
df['size'] = df['physical_description'].apply(extract_size_info)

# Print the updated dataframe
print(df.head())
```
Here's how the script works:

1. We load the `menu.csv` dataset into a Pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv`.
2. We define a function `extract_size_info` that takes a string as input and returns the extracted size information.
3. The function uses a regular expression pattern to search for the size information in the input string. The pattern matches:
	* One or more digits (`\d+`) followed by an `x`
	* Another one or more digits (`\d+`)
	* Optionally, a unit measurement (either "inches" or "cm") separated by whitespace
4. We apply the `extract_size_info` function to each value in the `physical_description` column using the `apply` method.
5. The resulting values are stored in a new column called `size`.
6. Finally, we print the updated DataFrame using `print(df.head())`.

Note that this script assumes that the size information is always in the format `digit x digit [unit measurement]`. If your dataset has variations in formatting, you may need to adjust the regular expression pattern or add additional logic to handle these cases.
